lists.js is a functional JavaScript library using mostly
arrays with a lot of Array.slice() to ensure immutability.

I'm used to functional list operations in Erlang and Clojure
so I copied a bunch of functionality here.

All functions have tests and can be tested with test.js.
The test.js file looks for all functions in the Window that
end in "Test", runs them and reports their output to
a "results" DIV.
